This project started out with the folder practice.js. Using an array of mock patient data, I was practicing using different array manipulation methods to extract data.
I then set up a PatientManager to help organize the various methods.
I am also learning TypeScript so I then began converting the code from JavaScript to TypeScript.  
This could be the beginnings of an app to manage patient data in electronic health records.
